# Embedded Computer Networks - STM32fF7
These are the previous lab exercises and and lab sheets for the embedded computer networks module at Sheffield Hallam University.  

In academic year 2021-22 we used the [STM32F7 discovery boards](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html) for this module and I have written some simple helper functions to help with some of the configuration stuff we are doing in the labs.

We also used the [ESP8266 WiFi modules](https://cpc.farnell.com/seeed-studio/317060016/esp8266-wifi-module-breakout-board/dp/SC14502?mckv=sVEipMTWw_dc|pcrid|224679642167|kword||match||plid||slid||product|SC14502|pgrid|47129782516|ptaid|pla-929885903229|&CMP=KNC-GUK-CPC-SHOPPING&s_kwcid=AL!5616!3!224679642167!!!network}!929885903229!&gclid=CjwKCAjwuvmHBhAxEiwAWAYj-B0l3FAypVNtEIppaZzfNAN8sSebz32FAlqlZ8PrsksdQlkt_joUqBoCVzYQAvD_BwE) with the AT version 1.7 firmware. More details (including a guide to hooking up the modules) is provided in lab 104.

All labs now use the CMSIS-Driver architecture and the MDK-ARM pack structure.

Note: as of academic year 2022-23 we are no longer using the STM32F7 discovery boards and as such this repository is obselete (and is provided solely for reference).
